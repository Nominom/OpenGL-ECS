# OpenGL-ECS
An ECS and OpenGL powered game engine written in C++


## A few words
This project is currently under development, but is already farly usable for playing around.
The ECS part is almost done, but the rendering part is still ways to come. In the meantime, you can poke around and look at my code. Or fork it for your own if you like.
 
 
## The origins of this project
I got interested in OpenGL during a graphics programming course in Metropolia. Which inspired me to actually create a game engine from scratch. My final demo for the course is also [available on github](https://github.com/Nominom/opengl-demo). The ECS part is inspired by the new Unity ECS system, which was first unveiled in 2017, and made available in early 2018. I decided to take the two and make an engine, learning lots of new stuff in the process. This is also my first project with unit and integration tests. 


## Libraries used
- Google test for unit and integration testing
- https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map for faster hash-map
- Opengl for graphics

## Build
The project is built with visual studio community 2017, but the code should be portable to other major compilers with minor modifications.
