# OpenGL-ECS
An ECS and OpenGL powered game engine written in C++

## Notice
This project is now archived. Some parts of it might still be useful for some people. My game engine development focus has shifted to .NET Core, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Nominom/.NET-Core-game-engine). 

## Libraries used
- Google test for unit and integration testing
- https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map for faster hash-map
- Opengl for graphics

## Build
The project is built with visual studio community 2017, but the code should be portable to other major compilers with minor modifications.
